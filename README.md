# DASS-Dataset-Filteration

This repository contains a comprehensive dataset of responses to the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS) questionnaire, along with tools and scripts for filtering, analyzing, and processing the data. The dataset includes raw responses from approximately 40,000 participants, as well as a filtered version for research and analysis purposes.

## Overview

The DASS is a widely used psychological assessment tool designed to measure the emotional states of depression, anxiety, and stress. This repository aims to provide researchers and data scientists with access to a large-scale dataset of DASS responses, along with the tools needed to clean, filter, and analyze the data effectively.

### Key Features:
- **Raw Dataset**: The raw dataset (`data.csv`) contains responses to 42 DASS questions, along with demographic and metadata fields such as age, gender, education, country, and more.
- **Filtered Dataset**: A processed version of the dataset is available, which removes incomplete or invalid responses and applies additional filtering criteria.
- **Metadata**: Each response includes metadata such as the participant's major, country, and time taken to complete the survey.
- **Scripts and Tools**: Scripts for filtering, cleaning, and analyzing the dataset are included (not visible in this excerpt but likely part of the repository).
