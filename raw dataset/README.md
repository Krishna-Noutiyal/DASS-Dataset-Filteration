# The RAW Dataset
---
The `DASS_data_21.02.19.zip` is the actual compressed file downloaded from (openpsychometrics.org)[https://openpsychometrics.org/_rawdata/]. It contains the `codebook.txt`,`data.csv` and an image of how questions were asked.


I have extracted the `DASS_data_21.02.19.zip` file and the `codebook.txt` & `data.csv` for ease of access so if you just want the dataset you can simply downlaod the `data.csv` and you are good to go 😁.
